## JSON Utilties in Python ##

#### JSON Lightweight Schema (LWS) ####

[JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) features some nice validation but it can be verbose and cumbersome to use.

JSON LWS offers a lightweight schema definition and validation in Python. Schemas are defined as Python dictionaries and serialized to pickle files for use in validation.
